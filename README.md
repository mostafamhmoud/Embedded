### 🔹 [FreeRTOS C++ Project for STM32F4](./FreeRTOS_project_C++)

In this project, I implemented a **real-time task scheduler** using **FreeRTOS** on the **STM32F4** microcontroller, with a strong focus on **modern C++ design patterns** and **embedded systems best practices**.

🔧 **Key Features & Techniques:**
- 🧱 **Class-based task design**: Each task is encapsulated in its own C++ class for modularity and clarity.
- 🔁 **Virtual functions & inheritance**: Enabled polymorphism for dynamic task behavior.
- 🧰 **C++ templates**: Used to build generic queue wrappers for inter-task communication.
- 💡 **Method overloading**: Enhanced flexibility in task handling.
- 🧭 **Namespaces**: Helped organize shared resources and prevent naming conflicts.
- 📌 **References over pointers**: Improved code safety and understanding of memory management.
- ⚙️ **FreeRTOS features**: Task creation, delays, queues, and scheduling mechanisms.
